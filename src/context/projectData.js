This project is useful as it is common for webpages to have a form either to fill in your personal information or to write a message/review. I enjoy this project as I was able to use flexbox for the very first time and it is indeed a powerful tool when trying to display your items in a certain way. For example, under ‘Contact Information' I used flexbox to show the label and input text box together as a column when viewing in Mobile screen mode and row in Tablet and Desktop screen mode.  Overall, it was an excellent experience and I managed to learn a lot about CSS such as attribute selectors and Pseudo-classes.",
